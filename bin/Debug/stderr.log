Vertically resizable combo boxes are not supported, but it happens that 10.4 and previous drew something that looked kind of sort of okay.  The art in 10.5 does not break up in a way that supports that drawing.  This application should be revised to stop using large combo boxes.  This warning will appear once per app launch.
