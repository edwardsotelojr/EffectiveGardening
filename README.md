# AnimatingViews

The Animating View sample shows how to use `CoreAnimation` to animate views. The code that does the animation lives in the `AnimatingViewsWindowController.cs` file and shows how to animate either using the simple API (just assigning a value to the Frame property) or manually controlling the animation's properties.
